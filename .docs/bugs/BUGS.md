## Open

### BUG-002: Markets hydration/navigation flicker (value-style oscillation and transient zero-state)
- **Status**: Open (Monitoring)
- **Severity**: Low
- **First appeared**: 2026-03-21
- **Related roadmap task**: T-018
- **Area**: UI
- **Summary**: All primary symptoms resolved. Route-transition delay, compact-value oscillation, zero-state on hard reload, and frequent zero-state on logo navigation are all fixed. A rare residual zero-state flash on `/currencies/[id] -> /` navigation remains — occurs seldom enough that active investigation is deferred to monitoring.
- **Fixes applied (2026-03-21)**:
  1. Module-level stale-while-revalidate cache in `markets-page.data.ts` (`getMarketsDataCache`/`setMarketsDataCache`): serves cached meaningful data instantly on SvelteKit navigation and revalidates in the background.
  2. `hasMeaningfulGlobal` guard in `AppShellLayout.svelte`: shell sticky-bar state only updates when incoming data is meaningful; prevents empty fallback from overwriting good state.
  3. `RouteProgress.svelte` component: shared purple top-of-page loading bar active on route transitions and initial page load (500ms `$effect` timer).
- **Residual**: Very rare zero-state flash on `/currencies/[id] -> /` navigation only. Not reproducible on demand; guards are working in the vast majority of cases.
- **Monitoring condition**: Reopen and escalate severity if zero-state becomes reproducible on demand or occurs more than once per 20 navigations.

### BUG-004: Contract / chain display blank for EVM tokens
- **Status**: Closed
- **Severity**: Low
- **First appeared**: 2026-03-21
- **Fixed**: 2026-03-21
- **Area**: Data
- **Summary**: The Info panel showed `--` for Contract and Chains on EVM tokens even when the server had a contract address stored.
- **Root cause**: The server stores a singular `contract` string field. `normalizeCoinBreakdown` in `coin-detail-page.data.ts` called `toContracts(data.contracts)` which expects a structured `{chain, address, logoUrl}[]` array — `data.contracts` was always `undefined`, and `data.contract` was never read.
- **Resolution**: Added an IIFE in `normalizeCoinBreakdown` that synthesises `[{ chain, address, logoUrl: null }]` from the singular `contract` string and `chains[0]` when no structured `contracts[]` exists.

### BUG-003: Coin detail info fields showing `--` despite server having data
- **Status**: Closed
- **Severity**: Medium
- **First appeared**: 2026-03-21
- **Fixed**: 2026-03-21
- **Area**: Data
- **Summary**: ATH, ATL, website, and community links all displayed `--` on the coin detail page even though the data was populated in the server store and present in the BFF response.
- **Root cause**: Three independent field-name mismatches in `normalizeCoinBreakdown` (`coin-detail-page.data.ts`):
  1. Server stores `ath`/`athDate`/`atl`/`atlDate`; normalization read `allTimeHigh`/`allTimeHighDate`/`allTimeLow`/`allTimeLowDate` — always `undefined`.
  2. Server stores `website` (array); normalization read `websites` — always `undefined`.
  3. Server stores `community` as a plain URL string array; `toCommunityLinks` only handled `{label, url}` objects — silently dropped all entries.
- **Resolution**:
  1. Aliases in `normalizeCoinBreakdown`: `data.ath ?? data.allTimeHigh`, `data.website ?? data.websites`, etc.
  2. `toCommunityLinks` updated to accept both `{label, url}` objects and bare URL strings (http-prefixed values only).

### BUG-001: MAX range persisted YTD-like series from web-side fallback snapshots
- **Status**: Closed
- **Severity**: High
- **First appeared**: 2026-03-19
- **Fixed**: 2026-03-20
- **Related roadmap task**: None
- **Area**: Data
- **Summary**: MAX chart data could collapse to YTD-like density when web-local fallback series were persisted as canonical snapshot ranges.
- **Expected**: MAX should represent full available history and not be overwritten by short fallback series.
- **Actual (historical)**: Web-local persistence could store short fallback data for MAX when upstream fetches degraded.
- **Root cause (historical)**: yact-web contained in-repo persistence and fallback snapshot logic that could persist degraded chart ranges.
- **Resolution**: Architecture moved to REST-only data consumption in yact-web and removed web-local persistence/snapshot modules.
- **Evidence commits**:
  1. 49cfa3c45b930dca728ec88ad4d2b47365328404 (snapshot handling moved toward analytics API)
  2. 3b466cf7183740e74f988ebfbf12c80feba9784e (persistent snapshot modules removed from yact-web)
- **Verification notes**:
  1. yact-web no longer contains persistentCoinSnapshot/persistentMarketSnapshot/persistentDatabaseWrite modules.
  2. yact-web no longer stores chart snapshots under apps/web/.cache.
  3. Chart persistence ownership now lives in yact-server; new MAX/YTD integrity issues should be tracked there.
